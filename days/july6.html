              <dd>Day 2/2 in the book for this week. With the holiday on monday and my NYC trip tomorrow! What have I even been doing? Um good question Grace. So for the past week and a half I have been playing around with the Thank You card for ODA camp that probably should have gone out about a week ago. I got scolded by Roger in our OKRA meeting about not sharing it so now it is up on the wall, for all to see. I am nervous about it, but eh, what can I do I need to move forard.</dd>
              <dd>On a much more random note, Ben texted me today. He got a project with a bike shop in his town doing some branding, etc. I am super excited for him, but it is kinda funny that he texted me just to brag. But I honestly would expect no less from him. I hope it goes well for him and that he asks me for opinions/crits.</dd>
              <dd>Cory is in a rough spot right now. His internship fell through and now he is stuck in this unmotivated state. I feel very helpless because I don't know what to say or how to help. He has a lot going on with his relationships, his parents, and his creative endeavors. I truly wish him the best and know this is just a phase of life, but I am not sure what to do. I am a very self motivated person so it is hard to help someone for whom that does not come naturally. But he started using his feelings as inspiration so I am excited to see where it goes.</dd>
