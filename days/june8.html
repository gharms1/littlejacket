              <dd>Not much going on this morning. Slight anxiety over the fact that a client had not yet made a descision on a design direction for a creative sprint. Thankfully we got a call and an go ahead on concept 2.</dd>
              <dd>Becuase of the Creative Sprint for CCPL, the Van Aken Street Naming project has gotten pushed to the back burner. I went back and made a couple changes to a survey that Roger then sent out to the client. I am excited to hear what they come back with. We were able to narrow the selection of names quite quickly. But honestly at this point I could personally recite the history of Shaker Heights.</dd>

              <dd>Since it had been a slow day I just ate at my desk and worked on this blog. Cory and I chatted about design, jobs, motivation, and Florence + The Machine â€“ who we are 90% sure is Aoife's alter ego.

              <dd>CCPL was the major project for the afternoon. I am pretty sure Alexander noticed that I didn't really have anything to work on, so he invited me to the meeting with photogrpaher Paul Sobota and his wife Dana. We grabbed coffee from our fave place: Rising Star and headed over to Mid Town.
              </dd>
              <dd>I have never been to a photo shoot/studio so this was a great introduction. Dana met with Roger, Alexander and I to work out the details on models, extra props for the shoot, and location ideas. We decided on four environments to shoot for the CCPL App campaign: pool, woods/backyard, parking lot, and bustop.</dd>

              <dd>AIGA Cleveland brought in Paula Scher to speak on branding as living, breathing designs. I was totally unprepared for the small talk mingling but it wasn't all bad. I finally got to meet <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shelbylizabeth/">Shelby Muter</a> who I follow on intsagram (and you should too).
