              <dd>We are on our third week of the creative sprint for CCPL!!! Alexander and I have been working on mocking up all of the digital ads for the new app campaign. Everything is going smoothly, we just need to "tighten up" the leading, copy, and font weights.</dd>
                <dd>We have to fit the images to a WIDE variety of sizes: everything from a skyscaper side bar ad to a med rectangle to a splash page to social media images. It is fun, but I am getting a wee bit tired of looking at the four GORGEOUS shots are using. Some are working out better than others<sup>1</sup>.</dd>
                <dd>The only tricky thing so far this week is that Roger has been out with Christian and Colin doing interviews at MH. ACS and I have been slacking him, but it is tricky to get a critique. We have all of the ads built to size so we just need a thrid set of eyes on it. Also we are waitng on the final edits from paul so we can drop those in to the ads.</dd>

              <dd> I have gotten a little frustrated on this project. Not that it is super challenging â€“ well maybe that is the problem. I need to remember that ACS has 10+ years of experience over me, but I shouldn't feel this shut down. I have only worked on one group project thus far, so working in a team is new for me. I am learning so much form him and everyone here, but I just don't want them to underestimate me.</dd>
              <dd> Also it is kinda awkward because we don't have a lot to talk about. I am not married/in a relationship, I don't live on my own, I haven't lived in another state. It has been a slow week but hopefully things will pick up tomorrow!</dd>
